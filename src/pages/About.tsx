            <p>
              Founded in 2018, Food Cart began as a simple dream: to bring delicious, 
              fresh food to our community in an accessible and friendly way. What started 
              as a single cart on the corner of Main Street has grown into a beloved 
              local institution, serving thousands of happy customers every year.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our founder, Chef Maria Rodriguez, started with just a passion for cooking 
              and a desire to share her family's traditional recipes with the world. 
              Today, we continue her legacy by combining traditional flavors with modern 
              culinary techniques, always using the freshest local ingredients.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that great food has the power to bring people together, create 
              memories, and make any day special. That's why we put our heart into every 
              dish we serve.
            </p>
