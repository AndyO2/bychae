            <p>
              Hi, my name is David Chae, and I'm the 20-year-old founder of by Chae.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started from my love for food and sharing that love with others has now become something real.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite still being in college, I took a bet on myself this summer â€” and I'm beyond grateful for each and every comment, DM, and all the overwhelming support.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is just the beginning â€” we're building the biggest matcha brand in the world, together.
            </p>
            <p>
              With love ðŸ«¶,<br />
